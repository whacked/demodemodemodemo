* a barebones flask app with migrations, autogenerated forms, and admin

- migrations with alembic via flask-migrate
- form generation via flask-bootstrap
- database admin via flask-admin

** usage

activate the environment with =nix-shell= and pre-set aliases will be displayed.

To use in-memory sqlite, use =run-in-memory=. Data is not persisted between runs

To persist data between runs, you must use the file-based sqlite.

run =initialize-database= to create the database, then =run= to start with the test database file

once the server has started, open the browser as flask indicates (default port 5000); open e.g. =http://localhost:5000/admin/= to reach the default Flask-Admin interface
