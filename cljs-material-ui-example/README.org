* minimal demonstration of loading material-ui components within a shadow-cljs project

at the moment, material-ui 4+ does not seem to work as-is although mui 3 works fine

** usage

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :eval never
nix-shell
watch
#+END_SRC

then open your browser to port 8080, or as shadow-cljs directs
